What is natural language processing?
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.

'The rain made things complicated' - Alonso
Fernando Alonso who finished second at the Monaco Grand Prix: "It was difficult. We opted to start on hard tyres. We gave up the possibility in Turn One.

"We tried to play a long game with the strategy but Max drove well on the mediums.

"We didn’t have any chance but then in the end, the rain made things complicated and hard to drive around in.

"I had no full power around the laps, the braking was fragile, it was not easy and I was surprised there was no safety car or incident. Everyone did a great job today."
